The world around us is undergoing a dramatic transformation, driven by the relentless

virtual assistants understanding complex inquiries, AI is rapidly reshaping industries, 
societies, and the very way we interact with technology.
This revised textbook, designed for students in Classes XI and XII, dives into the captivating 
world of AI, offering a comprehensive exploration of its core concepts, applications, and 
potential impact. As you embark on this journey, you will not only delve into the fascinating 
algorithms that power AI systems, but also examine its ethical considerations and its 
profound implications for the future.
This is no longer science fiction. AI is here, and it holds immense potential to improve our 
lives in countless ways. This textbook equips you, the future generation, with the knowledge 
and critical thinking skills necessary to navigate this rapidly evolving landscape. Through 
engaging exercises and thought-provoking questions, you will be challenged to not only 
understand AI but also to consider its role in your own future.
The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) recognizes the transformative power of 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its impact on the future. Building upon this successful 
introduction, CBSE extended the AI subject to Class XI & XII, starting in the 2020-2021 
academic session. Thus, allowing students to delve deeper into the world of AI and develop 
a more comprehensive understanding.
This AI Curriculum has been created with the help of teacher advisors managed by 1M1B 
and supported by IBM. This curriculum aligns with industry standards as set forth by the 
National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) at Levels 3 & 4.
CBSE acknowledges and appreciates the valuable contribution of IBM India in developing 
the AI curriculum and conducting training programs. This collaborative effort ensures 
educators are well-equipped to deliver the AI curriculum effectively.
By working together, CBSE and its partners aim to empower students to embrace the future. 
By incorporating AI into their learning experience, students gain the knowledge and skills 
necessary to not only understand AI but also leverage its potential to enhance their learning 
and future prospects.
The future is full of possibilities, and AI is poised to play a pivotal role. Are you ready to be a
